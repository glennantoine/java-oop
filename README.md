# Java OOP
Back to the basics for Object Oriented Principles

If you have ever found yourself at a point where you just wanted to spend some time writing code for the sake of writing code, then you will understand this repo. 

Neither Java or Object Oriented Principles are new to me but not having spent much time with either in the recent past I thought it would be fun to create this repo for the sole purpose of revisiting both. 

My goal here is to brush up on some of the basic OOP concepts with Java as the vehicle for doing so. 

Some of the principles that I plan to cover include:
* (S) - Single Responsibility
* (O) - Open/Closed
* (L) - Liskov Substitution
* (l) - Interface Segregation
* (D) - Dependency Inversion
  
There are so many design patterns out there, that I have no intention of covering them all but hope to refresh my memory on a few of the more common/commonly used Design Patterns:

* Singleton Pattern  
* Factory Method pattern
* Observer Pattern
* Dependency Injection Pattern
* Strategy Pattern
* Builder Pattern
* Template Method Pattern
  
And yes, while I am at it I may add some unit testing just to make it a bit more complete.   

At least for the moment my plan is to create a new branch as I change my focus.
